## 📦 Overview and File Metadata

* **Title:** SSISM Distributed Vigilance Engine V1
* **Filename:** `SSISM_Distributed_Vigilance_Engine_V1.md`
* **Version:** V1.0.0
* **Date:** 2025-12-07
* **Repository:** `UIngarsoe/-SSISMDISSEMINATIONENGINE_V1`
* **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0 (Public Domain — Mirror Everywhere)
* **Purpose:** Convert the **“Grand Bargain”** system logic into a distributed, community-run vigilance engine with branches, indicators, and operational rituals.

## 🛡️ Core Doctrine and Roles

The engine treats vigilance as a living system: open, modular, and executable by anyone. Its operation is an act of **'Doing Nothing as Value'** (from the SSISM V Smart Advisor), institutionalizing a verification and delay protocol via the mandatory execution of the script.

* **Analyst (Logic):** Encodes scenarios, thresholds, and alerts as machine-readable rules in `ssism_engine.sh`.
* **Scout (Signals):** Collects, verifies, and submits indicators to `indicators.txt` with minimal friction.
* **Archivist (Continuity):** Mirrors files, maintains SHA256 hashes, preserves ritual audio (OPUS), and scout maps (e.g., Delta Ghost Map).
* **Coordinator (Unity):** Pushes alerts across all dissemination channels and manages the counter-partition narrative.
* **Guardian (Ethics):** Ensures community safety, enforces redaction, and maintains a non-harm framing (No-Shame, No-Judgement Alert).

## 📊 Scenario Matrix and Decision Tree

The `ssism_engine.sh` script tests for patterns in `indicators.txt` and branches to the corresponding action ritual.

| Scenario | Trigger Pattern (in `indicators.txt`) | Primary Risk | Recommended Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **China Ultimatum Window** | `partition ultimatum`, `cmec guarantee`, `deadline`, `blockade` | Economic Coercion | Publish **ECON COERCION WINDOW** + Sanctions Routing Brief |
| **Partition Accepted** | `ceasefire boundaries`, `accept partition`, `regional autonomy deal` | Front Fragmentation | Publish **UNITY WARNING** + Federal Counter-Proposal |
| **Partition Rejected** | `regime-change rhetoric`, `advance beyond borders`, `delta offensive` | Escalation / Info War | Publish **FEDERAL PUSH** + CMEC Risk Brief |
| **Khin Nyunt Revival** | `sham election`, `conscription surge`, `paranoid orders` | Legitimacy Theater | Publish **LEGITIMACY DENIAL PACK** + Defection Amplifier |
| **MI Collapse Accelerates** | `warrants high`, `leaders uncaught`, `defector note`, `intelligence collapse` | Retaliation Sweeps | Publish **SAFETY RITUAL** + Scout Encryption Guide |

## ⚙️ Quickstart Runbook

1.  **Prepare Indicators:** Save lines of evidence (in plaintext or JSON lines) into `indicators.txt`.
2.  **Run Engine:** `bash ssism_engine.sh indicators.txt`
3.  **Review Artifacts:** Check the newly created `alerts/` directory for the output `[TIMESTAMP]_ALERT-TITLE.txt` and its corresponding `.sha256` file.
4.  **Publish Alerts:** Post the alert text to all `CHANNELS`; attach the `.sha256` hash for integrity verification.
5.  **Mirror Objects:** Push to **IPFS/Tor** mirrors; print locally; archive in the GitHub repository with a version tag.

## 📡 Output Rituals and Dissemination

Every executed branch emits a concise, mirror-ready package to ensure survivability, integrity, and unity across all mirrors.

* **Alert Title:** Short, declarative (e.g., UNITY WARNING, FEDERAL PUSH).
* **Action Bullets:** 3–5 lines, each beginning with a verb (as defined in `ssism_engine.sh`).
* **Channels:** Telegram, X, IPFS, Tor, local print nodes.
* **Tags:** `#IrrawaddyFiles #UnityWarning #FederalPush #ThreeHours`.
* **Hashing:** MANDATORY SHA256 of the output text (and optional OPUS audio snippet).

---
## 🔐 Data Hygiene, Ethics, and Safety

* **Redaction Discipline:** Remove all Personally Identifiable Information (PII) unless explicit consent and necessity for a non-harm alert are confirmed.
* **Non-Harm Framing:** Strictly no calls for violence. Focus on unity, safety, institutional collapse indicators, and defensive actions.
* **Confidence Tagging:** Encourage scouts to always include confidence levels in their raw indicators; the engine must never overstate the evidence.
* **Mirroring Etiquette:** Credit sources, maintain hashes, translate accurately, and preserve the ritual context (Collins quote, Tayzar San sermons).

---
## 🗺️ Roadmap and Extensibility

* **Quantitative Thresholds:** Integrate modules for real-time township control counts, defection rates, and logistics proximity metrics.
* **Language Packs:** Develop Burmese/English synchronized briefs with identical hashes for linguistic parity.
* **Scenario Weights:** Introduce branch weights and confidence aggregation to prioritize alerts (e.g., Bayesian or Logistic Regression-based scoring).
