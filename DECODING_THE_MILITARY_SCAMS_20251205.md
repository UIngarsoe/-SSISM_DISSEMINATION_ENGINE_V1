# Decoding the Military Scams  
**Min Aung Hlaing’s Post-Election Crackdown Signal — Fully Decrypted & Converted to V-Engine Logic**  
*SSISM Dissemination Engine V1 — 5 December 2025*

## Decrypted Intent Summary (Human-Readable)

**Original coded statement** (Min Aung Hlaing):  
> “Opposition groups will find it difficult to maintain their standing once a new government takes office.”

**True translated meaning** (actionable intelligence):  
The SAC will immediately weaponise the “elected” proxy government’s manufactured mandate to launch a systematic, legally-framed offensive against all revolutionary forces (NUG, PDF, non-cooperative EAOs) under the pretext of “protecting the people’s will” and “election disruption”.

**Timing:** Operation begins January 2026 — the moment the proxy cabinet is sworn in.  
**Outcome:** No peace, no transition — only intensified War of Attrition with a fresh coat of civilian legitimacy.
