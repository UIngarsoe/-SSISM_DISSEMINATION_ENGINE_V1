# 3. 🧭 Methodology Integrity Layer

### **3.1 Clear OSINT Classification**
Each report defines:

- Data source type  
- Confidence level  
- Verification stage  
- Analytical method  

### **3.2 Satire vs Intelligence vs Editorial**
To protect public safety:

- **Satire** → clearly labeled  
- **Editorial** → safe commentary  
- **OSINT analysis** → fact-grounded  
- **Threat intelligence** → non-sensitive, public-safe  

This avoids misinterpretation and protects readers.

Reports focus on:

- Behaviors  
- Trends

This keeps civilian protection as the top priority.
