### Executive Summary

Australian authorities and civil society now assess that the Myanmar military regime’s tolerance — and in many cases active protection — of large-scale cyber-fraud compounds along the Thai and Chinese borders has become a direct national-security and financial-stability threat to Australia. Conservative Australian estimates place citizen financial losses at approximately AUD 2.5 billion in the 2024–2025 period, with the majority traceable to compounds in Myanmar’s Shan State and Kayin State under the operational control of Border Guard Forces and militias aligned with the State Administration Council (SAC).

Australian policy, intelligence and law-enforcement communities increasingly view the SAC’s planned 2026 “election” — widely regarded as fraudulent — as a critical enabler for the continued expansion of these criminal ecosystems. A formal victory by the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) is assessed as likely to entrench existing impunity arrangements and accelerate compound growth, further exposing Australian citizens to financial predation.

This assessment aligns with briefings delivered to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), Australian Federal Police (AFP), and parliamentary committees in November–December 2025.

### 1. Scale of Australian Exposure

- Australian Crime Commission (ACCC) and Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) reporting indicates Myanmar-origin “pig-butchering” and investment scams accounted for 38–42 % of reported romance/investment fraud losses in 2024–2025.  
- Total reported losses exceed AUD 2.5 billion; unreported losses are believed significantly higher.  
- Primary compounds: Shwe Kokko, KK Park, Myawaddy-based complexes, and emerging hubs in Wa-controlled territory.

### 2. Regime–Criminal Nexus

- Border Guard Forces (BGF) and SAC-aligned militias provide security, electricity, and telecommunications infrastructure to scam compounds in exchange for revenue shares estimated at 20–40 %.  
- Multiple credible sources confirm SAC senior officers receive direct payments routed through Singapore- and Dubai-registered entities.  
- Chinese nationals dominate compound management; Beijing has periodically demanded crackdowns, yet SAC protection continues where revenue flows remain uninterrupted.

### 3. Electoral Implications

Australian government analysis concludes that a formal USDP “victory” in 2026 would:  
a) legitimise existing impunity arrangements in the eyes of certain regional actors;  
b) reduce domestic and international pressure on the SAC to dismantle compounds;  
c) enable further territorial expansion of scam operations into currently contested areas.

### 4. Current Australian Policy Posture

- DFAT has elevated Myanmar cyber-fraud to a Tier-1 bilateral issue in discussions with ASEAN counterparts.  
- AFP and FBI maintain active operational task forces tracing financial flows.  
- Parliamentary friends-of-Myanmar groups and Australian NGOs advocate targeted Magnitsky-style sanctions against known compound facilitators.

### 5. Conclusion

The Australian government and public no longer view Myanmar’s scam compounds as a peripheral criminal issue, but as a direct extension of the military regime’s survival strategy. Any electoral process that returns the SAC or its proxies to formal power will be interpreted in Canberra as a deliberate policy choice to sustain and expand a criminal enterprise that actively harms Australian citizens.
