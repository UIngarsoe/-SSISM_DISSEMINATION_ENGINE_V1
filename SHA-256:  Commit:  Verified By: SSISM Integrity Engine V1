# 6. 🌀 SSISM Integrity Engine V1 — Architecture

### **6.1 Multi-Layer Defence**
- Cryptographic hashing  
- Public GitHub commit trace  
- Metadata logging  
- Editorial discipline  
- OSINT methodology  
- Clear framing (satire/editorial/analysis)  

### **6.2 Zero-Trust Publication Model**
Assume any public document may be:

- Altered  
- Forged  
- Misrepresented  
- Taken out of context  

Therefore:

- Every release is hashed  
- Every file tied to a commit  
- Every claim context-labeled

# 7. 🧩 Why This Matters for Myanmar (2025–2030)

The information battlefield now equals the physical one.

The junta relies on:

- Misattribution  
- Fake leaks  
- Propaganda  
- Data suppression  

SSISM provides Myanmar with a **civilian counter-integrity structure** that is:

- Transparent  
- Cryptographically verifiable  
- Publicly auditible  
- Resistant to distortion  

This protects civilians from informational harm and preserves truth.
