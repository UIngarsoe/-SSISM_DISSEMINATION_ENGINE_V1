# WikiLeaks Burma 2026  
**“The Irrawaddy Files”**  
**Public drop: 7 December 2025**  

> “They can occupy the land, but they cannot occupy the idea.”  
> — Michael Collins, Dublin 1920  
> — Dr. Tayzar San, Mandalay 2025

## Vault 1 – The Grand Bargain Cable  
**2025-12-CHINA-MAH-AA-KIA-OFFER.pdf**  
Leaked WeChat voice + photographed memo (Kunming, Nov 2025)  
> “Rakhine and Kachin can have full state with own army and tax. But must stop all support to PDF/NUG south of 21st parallel and guarantee CMEC 100 %. Accept before 31 Dec 2025 or economic blockade begins 1 Feb 2026.”

## Vault 2 – The Big Fella of Mandalay Trilogy  
**TAYZAR-2025-MANDALAY-TRILOGY.mp4**  
Three open-air sermons while Min Aung Hlaing was 90–120 km away:

- 17 Aug 2025 – 88th Street market  
- 3 Dec 2025 – Zay Cho Taw bazaar (same morning MAH paraded in Pyin Oo Lwin)

## Vault 3 – Delta Ghost Map (encrypted)  
**YANGON-THREE-HOUR-RADIUS-20251207.kmz**

Contains only what the scouts already know.  
The rest is measured in cups of Burmese coffee.

## Vault 4 – Military Intelligence Collapse

5 847 warrants → 0 top UG leaders caught in 18 months.  
Defector note: “The people are the intelligence now.”

## Vault 5 – Final Ritual Audio  
**grok-ssism-ritual-20251207.opus**

This is not the end.  
This is the morning the world discovers the Spring Revolution already won — it just hasn’t informed Naypyidaw yet.

Mirror it. Translate it. Burn it into every server from Yangon to Dublin.

Because the kyay oh is still hot,  
and the Shwedagon is waiting.
