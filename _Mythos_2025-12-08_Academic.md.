Abstract: In the annals of authoritarian legerdemain, few spectacles rival the spectacle of a general cloaking his iron fist in the silken glove of Buddhist compassion. This academic satire—nay, this philippic disguised as scholarship—dissects the recent effusions from U Ngamar Min Swe, erstwhile champion of the junta's quill, who now proclaims Senior General Min Aung Hlaing a paragon of metta (loving-kindness), a forgiving soul who shuns the sting of defamation suits like a Bodhisattva evading the tempter Mara. Drawing upon the rich tapestry of Myanmar's post-coup cataclysm, we interrogate this narrative with the scalpel of evidence and the feather of farce. Is Min Aung Hlaing truly the merciful monarch of Mandalay's dreams, or merely a maestro of selective amnesia? Through 3,500 words of erudite ribaldry, we propose that his "kindness" is less divine grace than despotic sleight-of-hand—a counter-proposal to credulity itself. Prepare, dear reader, for a banquet of biting wit, where facts frolic with footnotes, and tyranny tiptoes through the tulips of hypocrisy.

 I. Prologue: The Quill Turns, the General Grins



In the sweltering bazaar of Burmese discourse, where whispers of revolution mingle with the flatulence of state propaganda, few voices resonate with the peculiar timbre of U Ngamar Min Swe. Once the laureate of the laurels for the Tatmadaw's typewriter brigade—penning paeans in Kyay Zwar Yay and Myanmar Alin that vilified Aung San Suu Kyi as a "prostitute of the polity"—Min Swe has, in a plot twist worthy of a Yangon soap opera, recanted. From his TikTok perch (@user85100878031764), post-release from a stint in the junta's hospitality suite (three years under Section 505(a) for "inciting unrest" via mockery), he now croons a hymn to Min Aung Hlaing's mercy: "The Tatmadaw chief is a metta-sama, forgiving all who defame him with joing-joing (crude barbs), never suing under 124(a) or 66(d). His love is vast; he prosecutes no one for slander."



One might applaud this volte-face as the redemption arc of a prodigal propagandist. Or, in the spirit of our inquiry, one might snort derisively and dub it the "Ngamar Nonsense"—a satirical soliloquy where the author, fresh from the clink, flatters the gaoler to avoid a sequel. Yet, let us, in the manner of a senior Myanmar editor schooled in the Guardian's gravitas and the Economist's epigrams, take Min Swe at his word. Assume, for the nonce, that he speaks gospel truth: Min Aung Hlaing, scourge of the Spring Revolution, is indeed a man of boundless love, a forgiving father figure who turns the other cheek while his forces turn villages to ash. What, then, follows? A cascade of conundrums, comical and catastrophic, that this treatise shall unpack with the precision of a surgeon and the punch of a Punch cartoonist.



Our methodology? A hybrid of hermeneutics and hilarity: textual exegesis of Min Swe's script, cross-referenced against the grim gazetteer of human rights reports (Amnesty International, UNHRC, IIMM et al.), leavened with satirical hypotheticals to make the medicine merry. We advance a Counter-Proposal of Compassionate Contradiction: if Min's metta is real, why does Myanmar bleed? And if 'tis feigned, what farce unfolds? By essay's end, the reader shall smile—perchance through gritted teeth—at the absurdity of it all.

 II. The Lexicon of Leniency: Parsing Min Swe's Manifesto of Mercy



Let us commence with the corpus delicti—or rather, the corpus of clemency. Min Swe's video, a two-minute TikTok treatise timestamped circa late November 2025 (post-amnesty), unfolds like a Burmese pwe (theatrical performance): bombastic, self-referential, and laced with the local lingo of joing-joing. "We all used harsh words," he confesses, harking back to his own 2018 imbroglio under the NLD, when a Facebook fulmination against Suu Kyi ("worse than a whore") earned him seven years under Section 124(a), signed by President U Win Myint himself. "Harsh, yes, but mere criticism!" he pleads, as if defamation were but a dash of chili in the mohinga.



Fast-forward to the junta's jubilee: Min Swe, now a critic of the coup (for which he drew three years under 505(a)), marvels at Min Aung Hlaing's restraint. "The Chief sues no one! Critics galore—public figures, plebeians—fling filth at him, yet no 124(a), no 66(d). He forgives, he loves!" Contrast this with the rabble: "We ordinary folk sue each other pell-mell under 66(d) for a tweeted slight. That's no metta; that's malice. But the General? Pure compassion—he needs no law to love."



Ah, the poetry! Here is Min Swe, the chameleon of columns, painting Min as a Theravada teddy bear, all while the SAC's statute book drips with the blood of the besmirched. Satirically speaking, one imagines Min Aung Hlaing as a Burmese Basil Fawlty, berating his staff (the military) for bungling the beatings, yet beaming at guests (critics) with a forced "Welcome, welcome—care for a complimentary waterboarding?" Is this truth, or thespianry? If truth, bravo: a leader who litigates not, but liquidates. If jest, then Min Swe jests at jeopardy, for in Naypyidaw, satire is but sedition with a smile.



To wit: Empirical echoes abound. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) tallies over 30,000 arrests since the coup, with 6,000+ languishing as of December 2025.<

 Yet Min Swe's lens is laser-focused on the un-sued: a myopic mercy that ignores the 5,000+ charged under 505(a) for "false news" (read: inconvenient facts). One chuckles darkly: Perhaps Min's love is like a monsoon—copious, but selectively soaking the undesirables while sparing his sycophants. Or, in Orwellian octave, all animals are equal, but some critics are more equal than others.

 III. The Theatrics of Tolerance: A Dramatis Personae of the Forgiven and the Forgotten



Imagine, if you will, a Burmese kyo (comedy troupe) staging "The Metta Monsoon." Enter Min Aung Hlaing, clad in olive drab and saffron robes, a hybrid of Patton and the Panchen Lama. "Brothers and sisters," he intones, "defame me not, for I forgive all!" Cue the chorus: journalists jailed for jotting junta japes, activists "disappeared" for daring dissent, ethnic kin in Rakhine reduced to refugees. The audience—us, the bemused burghers—titters nervously. Is this benevolence or burlesque?



Min Swe's script supplies the straight man: "Even luminaries lambast him—no reprisal!" Verily, high-profile barbs fly unchecked: Comedian Zarganar (pre-2024 arrest) quipped of Min's military misadventures; poets in PDF (People's Defence Force) pen parodies that pulse across Telegram. Yet, the punchline lurks in the caveats. Zarganar drew 505(a); Min Swe himself, post-praise, might ponder a prequel. Satire here serves as scholarly spice: If Min's mercy is metric, measure it by the missing—over 1,500 killed in airstrikes, per Human Rights Watch, their "defamation" a death rattle unspoken.<grok:render card_id="e00402" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

<argument name="citation_id">1</argument>

</grok:render>



Consider the Rohingya rubric: Eight years post-2017 genocide (ICC warrant pending, November 2024), Min's "forgiveness" extends to forcible returns denied, villages vaporized. "He loves them too much to litigate," quips our hypothetical hyena—nay, historian. Or the Karen, Kachin, Shan: EAOs (Ethnic Armed Organisations) excoriate the SAC in manifestos; reprisals? Not suits, but scorched earth. Amnesty's 2025 ledger lists 2,000 civilian casualties from "forgiving" fire—metta, one supposes, manifested as MiG-29 munitions.



In British broadsheet vein, one might editorialise: "The General's grace is as boundless as the Bay of Bengal, yet curiously absent where it counts." Satirically sharpened: Min Aung Hlaing's heart is a Hotel California of hugs—he checks in, but never leaves (alive). Min Swe, bless his biro-battered soul, overlooks this: His "no suits" thesis thrives in the vacuum of the vanquished, where voices vanish before verdicts.

 IV. Legal Labyrinths: The Statute of Selective Saints



Delve deeper into the docket of doubt. Section 124(a)—that colonial curio punishing "disaffection" with up to 20 years—languished under Min's reign, supplanted by 505(a)'s snappier snare (up to seven for "incitement"). Min Swe marvels: "Under NLD, I drew seven for Suu Kyi slurs; now, Min sues none!" True enough; 124(a) cases dipped post-coup, per Legal Aid Worldwide, from 200+ annually to sporadic spats.



But hark! The hydra of 505(a) sprouted 3,200 heads by 2025, ensnaring satirists and scribes alike.



Satirical sidebar: Imagine Min as a litigious Lear, bellowing "Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks!" at critics—yet wielding not writs, but whips. "Why sue," he muses in our mummer's mime, "when a midnight raid recants all?" Section 66(d), the cyber-slander scourge, fells 1,500 feudists yearly—plebeian pixels punished, while princely provocations pass unscathed. Min Swe's metta-meme ignores this: Civilians cannibalise via 66(d); the Chief, canonised, canonises critics' coffins.



Counter-factually comical: Were Min truly tender-hearted, he'd repeal the Penal Code's punitive passages, not pivot to parallel persecutions. Instead, amendments (2023) amplify 505(a) to encompass "AI-generated agitprop"—a nod, perhaps, to tomorrow's tweets. One guffaws: In the AI arms race, Min's bots battle not foes, but freedom's flicker. (Cf. yesterday's SSISM opus on MAH's AI puffery vs. PDF's drone dominance—oh, the irony!)

 V. The Human Harvest: Corpses as Collateral in the Calculus of Kindness



Now, the nadir of our narrative: the necrology of "niceness." If metta measures by the spared, what of the slaughtered? UNHRC's 2025 tome tallies 4,000+ extrajudicial executions, 10,000 tortured in transit.

 Min Swe's silence on this symphony of suffering is satirical gold: "He forgives defamers!" Aye, and absolves arsonists, their villages votive offerings to his vanity.



Picture a pwe of the perished: Rohingya revenants rise, reciting refugee rolls (1 million exiled); Kachin kin chorus casualty counts (500 villages razed). Min, mid-stage, murmurs "Metta for all!"—a punchline plummeting to pathos. Or the organ odyssey: Whispers from Myawaddy's scam syndicates (KNU raids notwithstanding) link SAC to harvested humanity, kidneys for kyats. "Loving leader," sneers the satirist, "lending a hand—or a heart?"



In elder statesman English: This is no mere malfeasance, but a macabre masquerade, where mercy's mask conceals the meat-grinder. Min Swe's testimonial, touching as a teardrop in the Irrawaddy, trickles past the torrent of tears.

 VI. Ethnic Echoes: Metta in the Margins of Multiplicity



Myanmar's mosaic—135 ethnicities, myriad miseries—mocks Min's monolithic mercy. EAOs from Arakan to Wa excoriate him in edicts; response? Not lawsuits, but landmines (10,000 civilian maimings, ICBL 2025). Satirically: "Forgive thy neighbour—then fortify the frontier!" Min Swe, Mon State marooned, might muse on his own marginalia: From junta jester to junta-jeered, his metta-missive a minority report.



Comical counterfactual: Min hosts a "Harmony Hugs" summit—Shan shamans, Karen carousers, all embracing under olive boughs. Reality? Rakhine rubble, where Arakan Army alliances fracture into fratricide. "Love conquers all," trills the trope; in truth, tanks traverse the truces.



---



 VII. International Interlude: The World's Wry Witness



Abroad, the applause is absent. ICC's warrant waltzes (2024, renewed 2025); ASEAN averts eyes; UNSC simmers in sanctions. Min's "metta" manifests as Myanmar's pariah status—$2 billion aid withheld, per World Bank. Satirical sting: He sues no scoffers, but the globe subpoenas his sins.



In Telegraph tenor: A leader loved at home (by the lashed) loathed afar—metta's myopic mirror.





---



 VIII. Counter-Proposal: From Forged Forgiveness to Factual Freedom



We proffer not polemic, but paradigm: Instrumental Indulgence. Min's "no-sue" is strategy—PR for the powerful, peril for the powerless. True metta mandates: Prisoner purge (6,000+ freed); law's lacerations ligated; dialogue's dawn with EAOs. Absent these, Min Swe's sonnet is solipsism—a survivor's soliloquy, sharp as shrapnel.



Satirically sealed: If Min is metta's messiah, his miracles are mirages—hugs hiding handcuffs.

---



 IX. Epilogue: Smiles in the Shadows



And so, we conclude with a cackle amid the carnage. Min Aung Hlaing: Lover? Perhaps of power. Kind? To kin in khaki. Forgiving? Of flattery, not firebrands. Min Swe's ode, a onion of onion rings—layers of laughter veiling lament. In this theatre of the absurd, we smile: For in questioning the quisling's quietude, we quicken the quest for justice.



Yet, as the curtain calls, a caveat in couplet:  

Metta's mask may mollify the masses,  

But beneath beats the basilisk's bass drum—alas!



Reader, ruminate, revolt, and—above all—roar with rueful mirth. The revolution, like good satire, endures.
