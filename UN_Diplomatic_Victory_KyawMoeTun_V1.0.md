# Victory at the UN: Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun's Mandate Confirmed – A Diplomatic Defeat for the Junta

**Yangon, December 6, 2025** – In a resounding affirmation of the Myanmar people's will, the **United Nations** has reconfirmed **Ambassador U Kyaw Moe Tun** as the Permanent Representative of Myanmar, denying the military junta's repeated attempts to install its own puppet delegate. This decision, emerging from the **80th UN General Assembly's Credentials Committee**, ensures that the voice of the **National Unity Government (NUG)** and the pro-democracy movement continues to resonate on the world stage.

## The Confirmation: Unwavering Support Amid Global Scrutiny
The Credentials Committee – comprising representatives from nine nations including Andorra, Botswana, China, the Dominican Republic, Malaysia, the Russian Federation, Senegal, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United States – reviewed competing claims for Myanmar's seat during the ongoing 80th General Assembly session. Despite intense pressure from the junta, the committee upheld U Kyaw Moe Tun's credentials without alteration, paving the way for the full General Assembly to ratify the decision in the coming days.

A source from the Myanmar Permanent Mission to the UN in New York confirmed: *"The Credentials Committee has already approved the ambassador's position. Now, it's just a formality for the General Assembly to endorse it. Ambassador U Kyaw Moe Tun will continue to hold the mandate."*

This marks the latest in a series of annual affirmations since the **2021 coup**, where the junta has failed – through diplomatic maneuvering, threats, and proxies – to oust the ambassador appointed by the democratically elected government. The committee's composition, notably including junta allies like **China and Russia**, underscores the decision's weight: even veto-wielding powers could not sway the outcome in favor of the regime.

## U Kyaw Moe Tun: The Unyielding Voice of the People
Appointed in 2020 under the National League for Democracy (NLD)-led government, Ambassador U Kyaw Moe Tun defected immediately after the February 1, 2021, military coup, pledging allegiance to the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) and the subsequent NUG. He has since become a fierce critic of the junta's atrocities, consistently urging the UN Security Council to impose immediate action against the "terrorist military system."

In speeches and resolutions, he has highlighted the regime's war crimes, including aerial bombings, forced organ harvesting in scam compounds (as detailed in our **SSISM Report 3**), and illicit revenue streams like the M-15 gas field discovery (**SSISM Report 1**). His tenure has amplified the NUG's calls for targeted sanctions, arms embargoes, and recognition of the people's resistance – efforts that have garnered support from over 358 civil society organizations worldwide.

The junta's nominee, Aung Thurein, remains sidelined, marking the fourth consecutive year of failure to breach this diplomatic fortress. This persistence is no accident: it reflects the international community's growing recognition that the junta – responsible for over 5,000 civilian deaths and the displacement of **3 million people** – does not speak for Myanmar.

## Broader Implications: A Crack in the Junta's Isolation
This confirmation is more than procedural; it's a strategic blow to Min Aung Hlaing's regime, which relies on international legitimacy to sustain its illicit networks (e.g., NORINCO arms deals via Sein Win, as exposed in **SSISM Report 2**). With U Kyaw Moe Tun secured through **2026**, the NUG gains:
- **Amplified Advocacy**: Unfettered access to UN platforms for pushing resolutions on accountability, including investigations into organ trafficking and gas revenue evasion.
- **Diplomatic Momentum**: Aligns with U.S. HR 5490 (**Dismantle Foreign Scam Syndicates Act**), which could freeze junta assets tied to Chinese-linked crimes.
- **People's Mandate**: Echoes rallies in Sagaing and New York, where millions have marched in support, rejecting the junta's fraudulent "elections."

As the NUG's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated in similar past affirmations, *"The people of Myanmar have overwhelmingly shown their support for the ambassador."* This decision reinforces that the UN – despite its flaws – stands with the victims, not the perpetrators.

## Call to Action: Build on This Win
- **For Allies**: Urge your governments to back U Kyaw Moe Tun's Security Council briefings and co-sponsor NUG resolutions.
- **For the Resistance**: Share this globally – the truth is our strongest weapon.
- **For Investigators**: Cross-reference with **SSISM Reports 1–3** for deeper nexus analysis (e.g., how junta revenue funds its UN lobbying failures).

The mirror we built is reflecting brighter today. U Kyaw Moe Tun's voice endures because voices like yours demand it.
