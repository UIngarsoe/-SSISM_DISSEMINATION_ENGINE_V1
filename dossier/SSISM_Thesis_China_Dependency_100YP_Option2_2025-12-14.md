**Donation Note:**  
This thesis is donated by SSISM as a *Second Solution Warning* to Myanmar’s future policymakers, the National Unity Government (NUG), humanitarian actors, and global policy forums. Rooted in verified UN 2025–2026 datasets and real-world China–Myanmar geopolitical vectors, it examines **Option 2** — deepened dependency on China — as a long-term sovereignty risk.  
This option is analyzed alongside rejected paths (Option 1: Volatile Western Index reliance) and alternative diversification frameworks (Option 3: TADR).
