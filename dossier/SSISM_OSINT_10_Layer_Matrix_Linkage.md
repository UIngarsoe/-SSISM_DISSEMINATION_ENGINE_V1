# SSISM OSINT 10-Layer Matrix Linkage  
**Systemized Intelligence Framing for Daily Analysis**

**Version:** 1.0  
**Maintained by:** SSISM Analytical Cell  
**Purpose:**  
To provide a repeatable, auditable OSINT analytical framework that links
observable reality → structured reasoning → accountable judgment.

This matrix is designed to be used **before writing** intelligence briefs,
op-eds, or analytical articles, and to be compatible with **any LLM**.

## 🎯 Core Principle

> Narrative is not evidence.  
> Authority without outcomes is not success.  
> Civilian appearance does not erase responsibility.

Each layer must be completed **sequentially**.  
Skipping layers = narrative bias.

## 🔐 Integrity & Verification (Optional but Recommended)

- SHA-256 hash should be generated after publication  
- Verification scripts should be stored alongside this file  
- Any modification requires a new hash  

---

## 📌 Intended Use

- Daily OSINT briefings  
- SSISM Intel Special Analyses  
- Media-safe analytical publications  
- Long-term accountability archiving

**SSISM Doctrine:**  
> What is not recorded will be denied.  
> What is recorded becomes history.
