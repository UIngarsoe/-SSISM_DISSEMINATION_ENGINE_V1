# 📢 Sao Harn Yawnghwe's Core Warning on Myanmar's Crisis (Dec 2025)

[span_3](start_span)Sao Harn Yawnghwe (SHY)[span_3](end_span) [span_4](start_span)— son of Myanmar’s first President, Sao Shwe Thaik[span_4](end_span) [span_5](start_span)— and an experienced statesman[span_5](end_span)[span_6](start_span), recently issued a significant warning regarding the escalating civil war in Myanmar[span_6](end_span).

[span_7](start_span)His warning is a strategic, geopolitical assessment[span_7](end_span) [span_8](start_span)that the prolonged conflict risks the loss of the country itself[span_8](end_span).

## 1. The Critical Warning: External Intervention

[span_9](start_span)SHY's most significant message is about the risk of foreign intervention[span_9](end_span):

> **[span_10](start_span)[span_11](start_span)"A prolonged civil war could even invite foreign intervention. Neighboring countries will not wait forever."**[span_10](end_span)[span_11](end_span)

[span_12](start_span)If Myanmar cannot resolve its own conflict, others may try—and that would be far worse[span_12](end_span).

[span_13](start_span)The continued "endless fighting risks the loss of the country itself"[span_13](end_span).

[span_14](start_span)This risk is high because uncontrolled war in Myanmar destabilizes the whole region[span_14](end_span)[span_15](start_span), and external powers might intervene to protect their own interests, not out of charity[span_15](end_span).

## 2. Structural Indicators for Intervention 🦚🎖️📡🤺

[span_16](start_span)The situation in Myanmar in 2025 shows four structural indicators that have historically preceded intervention in other countries (like Cambodia, Laos, and Syria[span_16](end_span)):

* **[span_17](start_span)State Collapse (Indicator 1):** The central government no longer governs much of the country[span_17](end_span).
* **[span_18](start_span)Cross-border Insecurity (Indicator 2):** Weapons, refugees, and fighters move across borders daily[span_18](end_span).
* **[span_19](start_span)Humanitarian Catastrophe (Indicator 3):** Neighboring countries fear instability spilling over[span_19](end_span).
* **[span_20](start_span)Strategic Corridors (Indicator 4):** China, India, and Thailand have major interests in border trade and energy routes[span_20](end_span).

## 3. SHY's View on the Conflict's Path 🦚🎖️📡🤺

SHY's message is based on two core assessments:

* **[span_21](start_span)Military Force is the Wrong Path:** Using force alone to solve political problems is the wrong path, as neither side will win decisively[span_21](end_span).
* **[span_22](start_span)Only Political Solutions Can End the Crisis:** Revolutionary groups understand that political issues must eventually be solved politically[span_22](end_span)[span_23](start_span)[span_24](start_span), but it is unclear whether the military understands this[span_23](end_span)[span_24](end_span). [span_25](start_span)This asymmetry increases the risk of open-ended civil collapse[span_25](end_span).

## 4. SSISM Assessment of Intervention Probability 🦚🎖️📡🤺

[span_26](start_span)The SSISM Strategic Analysis Division assesses three forms of foreign involvement[span_26](end_span), based on the current context:

* **[span_27](start_span)Border Security Intervention:** **Medium Probability**[span_27](end_span). [span_28](start_span)China or Thailand could create buffer zones if fighting crosses into their territory, refugees overwhelm border towns, or armed groups threaten strategic projects[span_28](end_span). [span_29](start_span)This is the most likely form of intervention[span_29](end_span).
* **[span_30](start_span)Humanitarian Corridor Intervention:** **Low-Medium Probability**[span_30](end_span). [span_31](start_span)UN or ASEAN states might push for protected corridors (especially in Kachin, Shan, Karen, Rakhine) if mass displacement escalates in 2026, though this requires international consensus[span_31](end_span).
* **[span_32](start_span)[span_33](start_span)Full Military Intervention:** **Low Probability (for now)**[span_32](end_span)[span_33](end_span). [span_34](start_span)This could shift to medium probability if airstrikes cause mass civilian deaths near borders, the SAC collapses suddenly, extremist factions rise, or a humanitarian mega-crisis occurs[span_34](end_span).

[span_35](start_span)[span_36](start_span)Sao Harn Yawnghwe's warning is directed precisely at the danger of losing national sovereignty and control over its internal political process if the conflict is not resolved by Myanmar's own people[span_35](end_span)[span_36](end_span).

## 5. SSISM Commitment Note

[span_37](start_span)The system is fully transitioned to heightened OPSEC protocols while continuing to produce public-facing, evidence-only reporting[span_37](end_span). [span_38](start_span)The platform’s maturity is demonstrated by its ability to generate complex, tamper-proof intelligence products that remain strictly factual and politically neutral[span_38](end_span).

[span_39](start_span)[span_40](start_span)Mission reminder: "Do no harm. Just keep reporting the truth"[span_39](end_span)[span_40](end_span).
