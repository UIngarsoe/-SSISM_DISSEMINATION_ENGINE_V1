Abstract

This dossier provides a clean, academic-grade analysis of Myanmar’s military power-retention architecture in the lead-up to and aftermath of the 2025–2026 electoral cycle. Drawing on structured OSINT, insider signaling, and systems analysis, the report argues that the current transition is not a transfer of sovereignty to civilian authority but a reconfiguration of military control through proxy actors, compartmentalized authority, and narrative management. The study introduces a four-node proxy framework—foreign interface, economic core, coercive enforcement, and system coordination—to explain regime resilience under international pressure.

 

1. Analytical Framework & Methodology

The SSISM 10-Layer OSINT Matrix is designed to avoid rumor amplification by separating roles, functions, and outcomes. Each layer is assessed independently and then recomposed to identify structural patterns rather than individual intentions.

Core principles:

•	Compartmentalization over personalization

•	Function over title

•	Systems continuity over event-driven interpretation

 

2. Strategic Context (2025–2026)

Myanmar’s planned elections and post-election parliamentary arrangements are occurring under conditions of sustained military dominance, sanctions pressure, and deep reliance on external economic partners—particularly China. Rather than loosening control, the military has adopted a strategy of civilianization without demilitarization.

Key contextual drivers include:

•	The need for international optics of transition

•	Internal elite management and loyalty preservation

•	Protection of military-linked economic networks

 

3. Layered Power Architecture

3.1 Foreign Interface Proxy (Layer 1–2)

Actor: Myat Tun Oo (MTO)

Functional Role: Civilian-facing strategic proxy for external relations, particularly China-linked infrastructure and investment projects.

MTO’s positioning reflects a deliberate separation between diplomatic engagement and core military command. While formally embedded in civilian structures, his functional authority aligns with military strategic priorities rather than parliamentary accountability.

 

3.2 Economic Core Proxy (Layer 3–4)

Actor: Nyo Saw

Functional Role: Custodian of regime-linked financial systems and family-military economic interests.

Control over foreign currency flows, state-military enterprises, and opaque
