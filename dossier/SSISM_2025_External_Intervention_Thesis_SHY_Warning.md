# 1. Introduction  
The Shan Herald News Agency (SHAN) recently published one of the most important political warnings issued by a senior Shan statesman in decades.  
In the interview, **Sao Harn Yawnghwe (SHY)** — son of Sao Shwe Thaik, Myanmar’s first President — issued a direct and profound caution:

> **“A prolonged civil war could even invite foreign intervention. Neighboring countries will not wait forever.  
> If Myanmar cannot resolve its own conflict, others may try — and that would be far worse.”**

From Bamar, Shan, Kachin, Karen, Mon, Chin, Rakhine, and all other national communities — the meaning is clear:

### **If Myanmar fails to solve its political crisis, the sovereignty of the entire country is at risk.**

This SSISM thesis examines:
- Why SHY’s warning matters now,  
- The structural conditions that raise the probability of foreign intervention,  
- Historical precedents in the region,  
- The current battlefield fragmentation,  
- The collapse of the national center,  
- And whether Myanmar in 2025 truly stands at the threshold of external military involvement.

# 2. Context: Who is SHY and Why His Words Matter  
Sao Harn Yawnghwe is not a casual commentator.  
He has:

- Lived through multiple civil wars,  
- Lost homeland and family estates,  
- Participated in political negotiations across decades,  
- Maintained dialogue with both military and resistance leaders,  
- Advocated for Shan rights while warning about national fragmentation.

His worldview combines **historical memory**, **personal sacrifice**, and **cross-ethnic political negotiation experience**.

When a figure with this credibility says:

> **“Endless fighting risks the loss of the country itself.”**

—it is not a metaphor.  
It is a strategic, geopolitical assessment.

# 3. Core Warnings from SHY  
## 3.1 Military Force Cannot Solve Political Problems  
SHY states plainly:

> **“Using force alone to solve political problems is the wrong path.  
> Neither side will win decisively.”**

This aligns with all SSISM models of the war:

- The military cannot reoccupy the country.  
- The resistance cannot quickly eliminate the junta.  
- Airstrikes accelerate radicalization but not control.  
- Territory will keep shifting like sand.

**End result: ongoing collapse without resolution.**

---

## 3.2 Only Political Solutions Can End the Crisis  
SHY says:

> **“Revolutionary groups understand that political issues must eventually be solved politically.  
> It is unclear whether the military understands this.”**

This is a major insight.

The resistance:
- Knows military victory is not enough.  
- Knows federal negotiations must eventually occur.

But the military:
- Continues using airstrikes,  
- Continues destroying towns and villages,  
- Continues believing territory equals legitimacy.

This asymmetry increases risk of **open-ended civil collapse**.

---

## 3.3 The Most Critical Warning: Foreign Intervention  
SHY’s most significant message:

> **“A prolonged civil war could invite foreign intervention.  
> Neighboring countries will not wait forever.”**

This is not speculation.  
It is **an assessment from someone who understands international politics deeply**.

SHY reminds us:

- Civil wars rarely remain internal.  
- Borders matter.  
- Refugees matter.  
- Militias spilling across boundaries matter.  
- Strategic corridors matter to China, India, and Thailand.  
- Uncontrolled war in Myanmar destabilizes the whole region.

If Myanmar’s crisis becomes an international security problem, outside powers could intervene — not out of charity, but **to protect their own interests**.

---

# 4. Comparative Cases: When Foreign Powers Intervene  
SHY’s warning reflects patterns seen in:

- **Cambodia (1970s–80s)** — Vietnam intervened.  
- **Laos (1970s)** — Neighboring powers shaped the outcome.  
- **Sri Lanka (1987)** — India sent military forces.  
- **East Timor (1999)** — Multinational peacekeeping force entered.  
- **Syria (2015–present)** — Multiple states intervened.

Myanmar shows **four identical structural indicators**:

### **Indicator 1: State collapse**  
The central government no longer governs much of the country.

### **Indicator 2: Cross-border insecurity**  
Weapons, refugees, and fighters move across borders daily.

### **Indicator 3: Humanitarian catastrophe**  
Neighboring countries fear instability spilling over.

### **Indicator 4: Strategic corridors**  
China, India, and Thailand have major interests in border trade and energy routes.

In all historical cases, these conditions preceded intervention.

# 5. Myanmar 2025: Is External Intervention Really Possible?  
SSISM assesses three forms of foreign involvement, each with different probabilities.

---

## 5.1 Form 1: **Border Security Intervention** (Medium Probability)  
China or Thailand could create buffer zones if:

- fighting crosses into their territory,  
- refugees overwhelm border towns,  
- armed groups threaten strategic projects.

This is **the most likely** form of intervention.

---

## 5.2 Form 2: **Humanitarian Corridor Intervention** (Low–Medium Probability)  
If mass displacement in 2026 escalates,  
UN or ASEAN states might push for protected corridors — especially in:

- Kachin  
- Shan  
- Karen  
- Rakhine

This requires international consensus, which currently does not exist.

---

## 5.3 Form 3: **Full Military Intervention** (Low Probability — for now)  
But “low” does not mean “impossible.”

It could shift to medium if:

- airstrikes cause mass civilian deaths near borders,  
- SAC collapses suddenly,  
- extremist factions rise,  
- a humanitarian mega-crisis occurs.

SHY’s warning is directed precisely at this potential scenario.

---

# 6. SSISM Assessment: Why This Warning Must Be Taken Seriously  
SHY’s statement is not emotional.  
It is strategic foresight.

### **His logic:**
- Myanmar's war is escalating, not de-escalating.  
- SAC cannot win militarily.  
- Resistance cannot unite fast enough to replace the state.  
- Civilians remain the primary victims.  
- Every neighbor is losing patience.  
- External actors may eventually take matters into their own hands.

If this happens, Myanmar could lose:

- sovereignty over border regions,  
- control over its internal political process,  
- bargaining power at future negotiations,  
- the possibility of a federal democratic union shaped by its own people.

---

# 7. Bamar Analytical Perspective  
From the Bamar majority viewpoint — which historically shaped the center — SHY’s message forces a difficult self-reflection:

### **Have we, as a nation, reached the point where other countries see Myanmar as incapable of solving its own problems?**

### **Is Myanmar, once the heart of mainland Southeast Asia, now seen as a political vacuum?**

### **And if intervention arrives, will it protect Myanmar — or break it apart permanently?**

---

# 8. Conclusion  
Sao Harn Yawnghwe is not issuing a threat.  
He is offering a final warning:

> **“If this crisis continues, it will destroy not only the public —  
> it will destroy the nation.”**

Myanmar now faces two choices:

1. **A political settlement led by its own people**,  
2. Or **a future shaped by external forces** who will intervene to protect their own interests.

His message aligns with SSISM's decade-long assessment:

### **Myanmar must solve this crisis internally — or risk losing control of its destiny.**

The question for all of us — Bamar, Shan, Kachin, Karen, Chin, Mon, Rakhine — is simple:

### **Is external intervention still avoidable?  
Or have we already crossed the threshold without realizing it?**

This thesis is published so the people can reflect, debate, and act — before the choice is made for us.
