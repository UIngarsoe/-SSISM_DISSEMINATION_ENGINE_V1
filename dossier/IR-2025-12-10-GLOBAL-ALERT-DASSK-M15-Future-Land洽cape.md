# GLOBAL ALERT  
## 27 Years for an 80-Year-Old Icon  
## $5 Billion Gas Lifeline for the Junta  
## The 2026 Political Landscape Myanmar Does NOT Want the World to See  

**Date:** 10 December 2025  
**Classification:** OPEN – FOR ALL GOVERNMENTS, MEDIA, HUMAN RIGHTS BODIES  
**Call to Action:** Immediate humanitarian release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi + choke M15 gas revenue pipelines  

### 1. The Death Sentence Written in Years  
Daw Aung San Suu Kyi (born 19 June 1945) is 80.  
Total sentence handed down by Min Aung Hlaing’s courts: **27 years**.  
Earliest theoretical release: ~2048 → she would be **103**.  
Realistic outcome under current conditions: **death in detention**.  

Leaked medical updates (Sep–Nov 2025):  
- Severe heart arrhythmia & low blood pressure  
- Untreated dental/bone decay → unable to eat solid food  
- Aftershocks from March 2025 earthquake injuries ignored  
- Denied independent medical care, solitary confinement in Naypyidaw  

This is not punishment. This is slow execution.

### 2. The $5 Billion Oxygen Tank: M15 Gas Revenues  
Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (M15) remains the junta’s single largest cash artery:  
- 2025 estimated illicit revenue: **≥ $5 billion**  
- Primary sources: Yadana, Yetagun, Shwe fields  
- Main buyers: Thailand (PTTEP), China (CNPC), with TotalEnergies still in joint ventures  
- Funds flow directly to SAC offshore accounts, bypassing all sanctions on paper  

Every day the world buys Myanmar gas, it pays for another airstrike, another conscript, another year in DASSK’s cage.

### 3. Last Night’s BBC Burmese Illusion  
1,183 women candidates = “record female representation”  
Reality:  
- NLD dissolved  
- 86 % of territory excluded from voting  
- Candidates from USDP & proxies pledge “legal accountability” (i.e., keep DASSK locked) and “strong security presidents” (i.e., Min Aung Hlaing in civilian clothes)  

A pastel parliament designed to launder dictatorship as democracy.

### 4. Myanmar 2026 – Three Futures, One Truth  
A. **Junta “Victory”** → USDP supermajority, mAh “elected” president March 2026, DASSK dies in cell.  
B. **Fractured Farce** → Proxy coalitions collapse within months, emergency rule extended.  
C. **Revolutionary Eclipse** → 70 % urban boycott + EAO territorial gains → de-facto federal Myanmar by late 2026, DASSK freed by people’s power.  

The junta is betting everything on A.  
The people are fighting for C.

### Immediate Global Actions Required  
1. **Humanitarian release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi** – no conditions, no delay  
2. **Full sanctions on all M15 joint-venture partners** (TotalEnergies, PTTEP, Chevron remnants)  
3. **Reject recognition of December 2025 / January 2026 election results**  
4. **Support NUG / PDF humanitarian corridors** and federal dialogue  

The world has watched for five years.  
It must not watch her die.
