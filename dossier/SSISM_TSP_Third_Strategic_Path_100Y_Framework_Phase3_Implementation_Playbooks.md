## Executive Overview

Phase 3 converts the Third Strategic Path from theory into **operationally executable governance playbooks**.  
It is designed to function under **conflict, fragmentation, sanctions, and institutional scarcity**.

This phase assumes:
• No immediate national unity  
• No monopoly on force  
• No international consensus  
• Limited legitimacy windows  

The framework therefore prioritises **sequencing, redundancy, and resilience**.

## 1. Implementation Philosophy

### 1.1 Rule of Sequencing

Do **not** implement reforms simultaneously.

Correct order:
1. Civilian protection  
2. Administrative continuity  
3. Economic survival  
4. Institutional legitimacy  
5. Political normalisation  

Historical evidence shows reversal occurs when this order is violated.

### 1.2 Parallel Authority Acceptance

Implementation assumes **multiple governance actors**:
• Interim civilian authorities  
• EAOs  
• Local administrations  
• Technocratic shadow institutions  

Coordination is prioritised over hierarchy.
