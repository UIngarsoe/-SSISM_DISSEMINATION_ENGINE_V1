# Layer 2: Strategic Situation Snapshot

**Standalone Academic Module**  
**Title:** Strategic Overview of Scam Ecosystems in Myanmar Border Zones, December 2025  
**Date:** 2025-12-15  
**Author:** SSISM Humanitarian Intelligence Cell  

**Operating Theatres**  
- Northern Myanmar (Kokang region, Shan State)  
- Thai–Myanmar border zones (Shwe Kokko, KK Park, Myawaddy)  
- Regional diplomatic interfaces (Naypyidaw, Bangkok, Beijing)

**Structural Drivers**  
1. Armed group territorial control and militia entanglements  
2. Fragmented cross-border law enforcement coordination  
3. High-profit cyber-fraud economies (pig-butchering, investment scams)  
4. Established human trafficking and recruitment pipelines  
5. Escalating international diplomatic and security pressure

**Snapshot Assessment**  
Scam hubs operate as hybrid criminal-militia enterprises. Enforcement remains uneven, predominantly externally driven (primarily by China), and structurally constrained by local power dynamics. Victim extraction continues to lag behind arrests and asset-focused operations.

**Verification Block**  
- Key Hubs Confirmed: Kokang, Shwe Kokko, KK Park, Myawaddy (2025 repatriation operations)
