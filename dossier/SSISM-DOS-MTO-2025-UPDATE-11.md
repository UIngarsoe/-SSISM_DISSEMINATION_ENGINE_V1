SSISM UPDATE ADDENDUM: Myat Tun Oo Post-ASEAN Trajectory  
DOSSIER ID: SSISM-DOS-MTO-2025-UPDATE-1 
Date: 16 December 2025  
Target Audience: ASEAN Digital Ministers & Senior Officials

Post-January 2025 "Civilianization" Shift
- Timeline: Following Bangkok commitments (17–19 Jan 2025), Myat Tun Oo transitioned from uniformed Maj-Gen to civilian attire as Minister of Transport & Communications / Deputy PM.
- Strategic Context: Part of SAC's broader election-era rebrand—senior commanders don civilian roles via USDP candidacy to signal "governance" while retaining military command chains.
- Observed Continuity: No operational rupture. Telecom/power/logistics under his portfolio sustained scam operations in Myawaddy, Shwe Kokko, and KK Park.

Scam Economy Updates (Jan–Dec 2025)
- Scale Surge: UNODC/Thai reports note 40%+ rise in cross-border scam victims; hubs now integrate AI-driven fraud (deepfakes, voice cloning).
- Enforcement Void: Zero verified joint Myanmar-Thailand raids or telecom blackouts post-pledge. Thai authorities report persistent border permeability.
- Revenue Signals: Scam zones' expansion implies state tolerance—estimated $2–4B annual flow to aligned networks (per regional intel estimates).

ASEAN Actionability
- Broken Pledge Review: Demand metrics on Jan 2025 commitments at next ASEAN Digital Meeting (Q1 2026).
- Sanctions Alignment: Flag Myat Tun Oo's USDP role for enhanced due diligence—civilian facade ≠ impunity.
- Regional Risk: Scam evolution threatens ASEAN digital economy; non-interference enables it.

Key Judgment: Civilian clothes changed; scam protection didn't. ASEAN cooperation requires outcome verification, not narrative nods.
