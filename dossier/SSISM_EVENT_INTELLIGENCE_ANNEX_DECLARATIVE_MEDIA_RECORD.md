# SSISM EVENT INTELLIGENCE ANNEX  
## Declarative Media Record & Evidence Handling Doctrine

**System:** SSISM (Strategic Signal & Information Synthesis Model)  
**Document Type:** Event Intelligence Annex  
**Status:** Open OSINT / Evidence Preservation  
**Maintained by:** SSISM Analytical Cell  
**Purpose:**  
To preserve *official declarative media records* used in staged political
events for later cross-layer OSINT analysis, accountability mapping, and
historical verification.

## 🎯 DOCTRINAL PRINCIPLE

> Statements made by power are evidence.  
> Evidence is not truth.  
> Truth emerges only after layered analysis.

This annex **does not judge**.  
It **records, classifies, and preserves**.

## 🧠 ANALYTICAL RULE (CRITICAL)

> In staged press events:  
> **The opening statement is the script.**  
> The Q&A is a performance constrained by that script.

Therefore:
- Opening statements anchor permissible discourse
- Friendly questions reinforce pre-set conclusions
- Hostile questions trigger deflection or aggression

## 🔍 INTENDED OSINT USE (10-LAYER LINKAGE)

These records are to be analyzed against:

- **Layer 2 — Declarative Record**  
- **Layer 5 — Operational Outcomes**  
- **Layer 8 — Narrative & Reputation Management**  
- **Layer 9 — Political / Transitional Context**

Judgment must never be applied at the annex stage.

## 🔐 EVIDENCE HANDLING & INTEGRITY

- This annex should be sealed with SHA-256 after publication
- Any modification requires a new hash
- Videos are treated as immutable public records
- Removal or deletion elsewhere increases evidentiary value here

---

## 📚 WHY THIS MATTERS

When power collapses, narratives disappear.  
Archives remain.

> What is recorded cannot be erased —  
> only explained later.

---

**SSISM Doctrine:**  
Record first.  
Analyze later.  
Judge only after layers converge.
