* **The Threat:** Once operational, the field is predicted to **double or triple** the current annual foreign currency reserves derived from gas exports (from $\sim\$1$ Billion to $\sim\$3$ Billion+).
* **The Purpose:** This repository archives the intelligence **ahead of any major media reports** to facilitate immediate, targeted policy intervention.
