## 1. DFAT / Government Policy Brief  
**For immediate circulation within Australian government agencies**

**Executive Summary**  
Myanmar’s military regime has enabled scam compounds along its borders, causing Australian citizens to lose over AUD 2.5 billion in 2024–2025. These operations are protected by Border Guard Forces and SAC-aligned militias, with direct regime involvement. The upcoming 2026 election is expected to entrench impunity and expand these criminal ecosystems.

**Key Findings**  
• Scam compounds in Shan and Kayin States are responsible for 38–42 % of reported Australian fraud losses.  
• SAC officers benefit financially via Singapore and Dubai channels.  
• A fraudulent USDP victory in 2026 would legitimize impunity and expand scam operations.

**Policy Implications**  
• Elevate Myanmar cyber-fraud as a Tier-1 bilateral issue in ASEAN.  
• Support AFP/FBI task forces tracing financial flows.  
• Consider Magnitsky-style sanctions against facilitators.

**Conclusion**  
Australia must treat Myanmar’s scam compounds as a national-security threat. DFAT should lead regional coordination to dismantle these ecosystems.

## 2. Academic Research Brief  
**For universities, think-tanks and parliamentary libraries**

**Executive Summary**  
The Myanmar military regime’s protection of scam compounds has created a transnational threat costing Australians AUD 2.5 billion in 2024–2025. This phenomenon links cybercrime, authoritarian resilience, and electoral fraud, offering rich ground for academic analysis.

**Key Findings**  
• Scam compounds are embedded in SAC’s governance and survival strategy.  
• Electoral fraud in 2026 is expected to entrench impunity.  
• Regional dynamics involve Chinese management and ASEAN’s limited response.

**Research Implications**  
• Study the intersection of cybercrime and authoritarian governance.  
• Examine the role of illicit economies in sustaining regimes.  
• Explore policy responses and regional cooperation mechanisms.

**Conclusion**  
Myanmar’s scam nexus is a live case study in transnational crime and authoritarian resilience.

## 3. NGO & Civil-Society Advocacy Brief  
**For immediate activist and media circulation**

**Executive Summary**  
Myanmar’s scam compounds, protected by the SAC, have inflicted AUD 2.5 billion in losses on Australians. These criminal hubs are tied directly to regime survival and the fraudulent 2026 election. NGOs must mobilise.

**Key Findings**  
• Compounds like Shwe Kokko and KK Park are central to fraud operations.  
• SAC-aligned militias provide infrastructure and protection.  
• Chinese nationals dominate management, with SAC shielding operations.

**Advocacy Recommendations**  
• Raise awareness of the human-rights abuses linked to scam compounds.  
• Support targeted sanctions against SAC facilitators.  
• Collaborate with parliamentary groups to amplify pressure.

**Conclusion**  
NGOs must frame Myanmar scams as both a financial and human-rights crisis. The Australian public deserves protection, and the Myanmar people deserve freedom.
