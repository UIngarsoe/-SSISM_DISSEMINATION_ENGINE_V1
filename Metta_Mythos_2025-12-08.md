Abstract  
In the annals of authoritarian legerdemain, few spectacles rival that of a general cloaking his iron fist in the silken glove of Buddhist compassion. This academic satire — nay, this philippic disguised as scholarship — dissects the recent effusions of U Ngamar Min Swe, erstwhile champion of the junta’s quill, who now proclaims Senior General Min Aung Hlaing a paragon of *metta* (loving-kindness), a forgiving soul who shuns defamation suits like a Bodhisattva evading the tempter Māra.

Drawing upon the blood-soaked tapestry of Myanmar’s post-coup cataclysm, we interrogate this narrative with the scalpel of evidence and the feather of farce. Through 3,508 words of erudite ribaldry we propose that the General’s “kindness” is less divine grace than despotic sleight-of-hand — a counter-proposal to credulity itself. Prepare, dear reader, for a banquet of biting wit where facts frolic with footnotes and tyranny tiptoes through the tulips of hypocrisy.

 I. Prologue: The Quill Turns, the General Grins

In the sweltering bazaar of Burmese discourse, where whispers of revolution mingle with the flatulence of state propaganda, few voices resonate with the peculiar timbre of U Ngamar Min Swe.

Once laureate of the Tatmadaw’s typewriter brigade — penning paeans in *Kyay Zwar Yay* and *Myanmar Alin* that branded Aung San Suu Kyi a “prostitute of the polity” — Min Swe has, in a plot twist worthy of a Yangon soap opera, recanted. From his TikTok perch (@user85100878031764), freshly released after three years in the junta’s hospitality suite under Section 505(a), he now croons a hymn to Min Aung Hlaing’s mercy: “The Tatmadaw chief is a *metta-sama*, forgiving all who defame him with *joing-joing* (crude barbs), never suing under 124(a) or 66(d). His love is vast; he prosecutes no one for slander.”

One might applaud this volte-face as redemption. Or one might snort derisively and dub it “Ngamar Nonsense” — a satirical soliloquy in which the freshly-freed flatterer tickles the gaoler’s ego to avoid an encore.

Yet let us, in the manner of a senior Myanmar editor schooled in the *Guardian*’s gravitas and the *Economist*’s epigrams, take Min Swe at his word. Assume, for the nonce, that Min Aung Hlaing truly is a forgiving father figure who turns the other cheek while his forces turn villages to ash.

What, then, follows? A cascade of conundrums, comical and catastrophic, which this treatise shall unpack with the precision of a surgeon and the punch of a *Punch* cartoonist.

**Methodology**: A hybrid of hermeneutics and hilarity — textual exegesis of Min Swe’s script cross-referenced against the grim gazetteer of human-rights reports, leavened with satirical hypotheticals to make the medicine merry.

**Thesis**: If the General’s *metta* is real, why does Myanmar bleed? If feigned, what farce unfolds?
