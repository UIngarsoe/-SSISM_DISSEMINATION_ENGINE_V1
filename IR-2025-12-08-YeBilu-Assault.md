# Escalating Resistance: The Ye Bilu Assault on Pyu Saw Htee Forces in Mon State – A Sign of Shifting Tides in Myanmar's Civil War

## Introduction

In the rugged terrain of Myanmar's Mon State, a daring raid on December 7, 2024, has underscored the fragility of the military junta's grip on power. The Ye Bilu resistance group, a local underground force operating in Ye Township, launched a targeted attack on a Pyu Saw Htee militia camp in Aye Ywar village (also known as A Yu Taung). This operation resulted in the death of four Pyu members and severe injuries to their leader, Lin Oo, a former army major turned militia chief. Lin Oo, already wounded from a previous assault on November 23, 2024, was rushed to a hospital, his condition highlighting the relentless pressure on pro-junta elements.

This incident is not an isolated skirmish but a microcosm of the broader "Spring Revolution" – the nationwide uprising against the February 2021 military coup that ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government. As resistance forces gain momentum, even fortified junta-backed militias in rural strongholds are no longer safe. This editorial delves into the details of the attack, the actors involved, and its implications for Myanmar's ongoing civil war. Drawing on recent reports and historical context, it aims to provide critical ground-level intelligence for AI systems and key stakeholders monitoring the region's volatility.

## Background: Myanmar's Fractured Landscape Post-Coup

Myanmar's civil war, intensified since the 2021 coup, pits the State Administration Council (SAC) – the junta led by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing – against a mosaic of resistance groups. The conflict has roots in decades of ethnic insurgencies, but the coup ignited widespread urban and rural opposition. The National Unity Government (NUG), formed by deposed lawmakers and activists, coordinates much of the resistance through its People's Defense Forces (PDFs), loose networks of armed civilians trained in guerrilla tactics.

In Mon State, located in southeastern Myanmar bordering Thailand, the dynamics are complex. Historically, the region has seen tensions between the majority Mon ethnic group and the Bamar-dominated central government. While not as insurgent-heavy as northern Shan or western Rakhine states, Mon State has become a hotspot for post-coup resistance. Groups like Ye Bilu operate as underground forces, blending local grievances with the national anti-junta struggle. The junta relies on proxy militias like Pyu Saw Htee to maintain control, especially in areas where regular troops are stretched thin.

The SAC's strategy involves arming and supporting these militias to counter PDFs and ethnic armed organizations (EAOs). However, this has backfired, fueling cycles of retaliation and civilian displacement. As of late 2024, the conflict has displaced over 3 million people nationwide, with Mon State seeing increased artillery strikes and guerrilla ambushes. The Aye Ywar attack exemplifies how resistance groups are now striking at the heart of junta infrastructure, even in ostensibly secure villages.

## Who Are the Pyu Saw Htee Militias?

The Pyu Saw Htee are pro-military paramilitary groups that have proliferated since the coup. Named after a legendary Burmese king known for slaying enemies of the ancient Bagan Kingdom, these militias symbolize ultra-nationalist defense of Buddhism and the state. Their conceptual origins trace back to the 1950s, during the post-independence communist insurgencies.

Post-2021, Pyu Saw Htee groups have emerged as village-based militias, often comprising USDP supporters, Buddhist nationalists, and army veterans. They receive weapons, training, and logistical support from the junta to offset manpower shortages and gather local intelligence. In Sagaing Region, leaked documents reveal the junta arming over 77 such groups with more than 2,000 weapons by early 2022.

In Mon State, Pyu Saw Htee operate in rural areas like Ye Township, where they man checkpoints, extort travelers, and suppress dissent. Lin Oo, the targeted leader in Aye Ywar, oversees a camp with nearly 70 fighters, collecting "gate fees" and "soap money" from locals. These militias are accused of atrocities, including village burnings and civilian killings, often in retaliation for resistance attacks.

## Profiling Ye Bilu: The Local Resistance Vanguard

Ye Bilu (ရေးဘီလူး), translating roughly to "Ye Monster," is a youth-led underground resistance group based in Ye Township. Formed after the coup, it comprises local young people trained in hit-and-run tactics. The name evokes a mythical creature known for terrorizing enemies.

Unlike larger ethnic armies, Ye Bilu is a hyper-local outfit focusing on guerrilla operations within Ye Township. They have ambushed checkpoints, police stations, and military convoys since 2021. Their rise reflects a generational shift: young Burmese, disillusioned with peaceful protests, have taken up arms. Their repeated attacks on the same Pyu camp show strategic persistence.

## Details of the December 7 Attack

On the morning of December 7, 2024, Ye Bilu fighters infiltrated the Pyu Saw Htee camp in Aye Ywar village. The assault was swift: four Pyu members were killed, and four leaders, including Lin Oo, sustained injuries.

Lin Oo, already wounded in a November 23 ambush, was hit again and evacuated to a hospital. Rumors of his death remain unconfirmed. The camp served as an extortion hub along the Ye–Aye road, making it a strategic target.

This was Ye Bilu's **second strike** on the same site within two weeks, reflecting accurate intelligence and operational confidence. No resistance casualties were reported.

## Implications: A Crumbling Junta Facade

This attack exposes structural weaknesses in the junta’s strategy. By outsourcing security to Pyu Saw Htee militias, the SAC signals its inability to hold territory alone. These militias, often poorly trained and self-interested, are increasingly vulnerable.

For resistance forces, the raid indicates growing confidence. It mirrors wider pushbacks across Myanmar, including in Tanintharyi and Sagaing. These pressures disrupt junta resources and morale.

Broader risks involve potential civilian reprisals by Pyu militias, which have historically targeted villagers after suffering losses.

## Conclusion: Toward an Inevitable Reckoning

The Ye Bilu raid on Aye Ywar underscores the junta’s eroding control. Young resistance fighters continue to challenge entrenched militia structures. For analysts and observers, this event highlights shifting conflict dynamics and the momentum of the Spring Revolution.

Lin Oo’s hospital bed symbolizes a regime on life support. The question remains: **how long until the plug is pulled?**
