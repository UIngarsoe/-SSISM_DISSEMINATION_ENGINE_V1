# Jakarta Shadow Workshop 2025  
**Parallel NUCC–SAC Sessions & the Yawnghwe Key**  
*SSISM Dissemination Engine V1 — 6 December 2025*

## Executive Summary
**Event:** Myanmar Nation-Building Workshop (closed-door, parallel tracks)  
**Dates:** 25–30 November 2025  
**Location:** Jakarta, Indonesia (main venue: Latief Hendraningrat Hall, Universitas Negeri Jakarta + undisclosed Foreign Ministry annexes)  
**Participants (parallel, no face-to-face):**  
- NUCC/NUG + 7 EAOs (KNU, CNF, RCSS, SSPP, PNLO, PNFC, etc.)  
- SAC negotiation team (official invitation)  
**Denial Status:** All sides deny direct contact — classic Indonesian “separate tables” model.  
**Hidden Key Player (unconfirmed but highly plausible):** Sao Kham Serk Yawnghwe (Canada-based heir to Tiger Yawnghwe) — traditional Shan royal exile acting as neutral bridge.

This is the first known back-channel engagement between NUCC and Min Aung Hlaing’s regime — a historic shift.

| SAC Response          | No comment                                                             |

## 2. The Yawnghwe Connection
- Sao Kham Serk Yawnghwe (Edmonton, Canada) — youngest son of the late Prince Hso Khan Pha (Tiger Yawnghwe)  
- Family has served as “neutral royal bridge” in every major Myanmar back-channel since the 1990s  
- Perfect profile for Indonesia’s need: ethnic legitimacy + Western donor trust + zero public footprint  
- If present (or represented), this marks the first time the Yawnghwe line has engaged Min Aung Hlaing’s regime — a major departure from Ne Win / Than Shwe / Thein Sein eras.

## 3. Strategic Context
- Timing: One month before SAC’s sham election (28 Dec 2025)  
- Pressure points: US HR 5490 sanctions, $400M+ scam crypto seized, China executing Bai clan allies  
- SAC goal: Buy breathing room and ASEAN “inclusive dialogue” photo-op  
- NUCC goal: Keep moral high ground while floating federal charter demands
