# Morning Coffee Briefing – Myanmar 2025 Election  
## A Surge of Women Candidates Under an Election Shaped by Military Control  
**Date:** December 10, 2025  

Myanmar is moving toward its long-delayed general election on December 28, with a second phase scheduled for January 2026. This week, attention has centered on the unprecedented rise in women candidates: **1,183 women are contesting seats across the country** — the highest number in Myanmar’s parliamentary history and a major increase from 2020 and 2015.

This surge is partly explained by the military council’s shift to a proportional representation system, which encourages parties to field larger slates of candidates. While this appears to boost women’s political participation, the broader electoral environment remains highly constrained:

- The NLD has been dissolved.  
- Major opposition figures remain jailed or barred.  
- Voting is cancelled in conflict-affected regions covering large parts of the country.  
- International observers warn the process is neither free nor broadly inclusive.  

The UN and rights groups continue to describe the election as one that risks reinforcing military authority rather than promoting democratic reform.

# Women Candidates on BBC Burmese: Signals Behind the Answers  

A BBC Burmese interview yesterday featured three female candidates, one each from:

- **Ethnic Unity and Democracy Party (UDP)**  
- **Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP)**  
- **People’s Party (PPP)**  

Their responses were polite and professional, yet consistently aligned with pro-establishment narratives — particularly on two sensitive issues.

## 1. On Daw Aung San Suu Kyi  
All three candidates emphasized themes like “upholding the law” and “taking action against wrongdoers,” without naming Suu Kyi directly. The subtext was clear:

- None expressed support for re-evaluating her legal cases.  
- None advocated reforms that could affect her situation.  

Even with over a thousand potential female MPs, many from pro-regime parties, the likelihood of legislation benefiting Suu Kyi remains low. Instead, the next parliament may reinforce existing legal frameworks that maintain the status quo.

## 2. On Selecting a President  
The candidates stressed the need for a leader who is:

- **strong**  
- **security-focused**  
- **capable of managing “internal and external threats”**  

In Myanmar’s current context, such language often signals alignment with military leaders or their close civilian allies. Security was repeatedly elevated above democratic reform.

# The Women's Agenda: Symbolic or Substantive?  

Each candidate pledged to address women’s issues — economic pressures, protection mechanisms, and opportunities. Yet with:

- one-quarter of seats reserved for the military, and  
- leading opposition parties removed,  

the structural capacity for meaningful reform remains limited. Analysts caution that the dramatic increase in female candidates may function more as **political optics** than genuine empowerment.

# Escalating Rhetoric From the USDP  

Recent USDP campaign events included assertive statements from some members regarding groups and individuals who oppose the military. One official later distanced the party from these remarks, saying they did not reflect official policy. Yet other members continued similar messaging, creating internal contradictions.

Notably, **USDP Chairman U Khin Yi has remained publicly silent** on these controversies — neither clarifying nor condemning them. This silence has drawn criticism from within the party and raises questions about future policy direction should the USDP dominate the next parliament.

# What the Post-Election Parliament May Look Like  

Current indicators suggest the new parliament may feature:

- **a historically large number of women MPs**, but  
- **a clear majority aligned with the military**, either directly or through loyalist parties.  

Under this configuration:

- Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s situation is unlikely to improve.  
- Ethnic political voices will remain limited.  
- Democratic reforms are improbable.  
- Security and stability narratives will overshadow reconciliation.  

ASEAN has declined to send observers. Western governments remain skeptical. However, neighboring states prioritizing regional stability — such as China and Thailand — may quietly accept the outcome.

---

# Bottom Line  

Myanmar may soon see unprecedented numbers of women in parliament, yet **representation without freedom** offers limited democratic value.

The election risks becoming a display of inclusiveness rather than a step toward meaningful political space. Without addressing fundamental legal and political constraints, numerical gains alone cannot resolve Myanmar’s deeper crisis.

**A reminder to the international community:**  
Representation contributes to democracy, but **accountability** sustains it.
