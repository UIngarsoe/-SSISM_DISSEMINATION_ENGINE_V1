SSISM Truths Compilation 
MAH’s AI, Drone, and Cyber Claims vs Battlefield Truths
This compilation aggregates verifiable truths from OSINT sources, including reports on Min Aung Hlaing's (MAH) recent statements. All content is based on public records and independent journalism—no fabrications. Focus: Exposing gaps between junta claims and ground realities to empower resistance and inform global audiences.
 1. Core Truth: MAH's Speech on Technological Superiority
- Claim Date/Context: December 3, 2025, at Defense Services Academy (DSA) graduation in Pyin Oo Lwin. MAH stated modern warfare shifts from manpower to "air superiority, electronic warfare dominance, and precision modern weaponry."
- Verifiable Elements: Emphasized AI for real-time intel, counter-drone tech improvements, and cyber operations as decisive.
- Source Basis: Independent media coverage confirms the speech's content, highlighting reliance on foreign tech amid ongoing conflicts.
2. Truth on AI Capabilities 
- Junta Claim: AI enables real-time enemy tracking and battlefield intel fusion.
- Reality Check: No operational AI systems deployed. Reliance on manual scouts; intel often outdated by hours/days. Infrastructure lacks reliable networks, power, or sensors in conflict zones like Rakhine and Kachin.
- Evidence: Defector interviews and procurement leaks show no advanced AI R&D. PDF/EAO forces evade detection routinely.
- Impact: Claims are aspirational propaganda, not battlefield changers.
 3. Truth on Drone and Counter-Drone Tech 
- Junta Claim: Continuous updates to counter-drone strategies; drones as key to superiority.
- Reality Check: Limited, imported jammers (short-range, vulnerable to frequency hopping). Resistance conducts thousands of drone sorties monthly, inflicting heavy losses.
- Evidence: Chinese-made drones bolstered junta, but fuel/maintenance issues ground fleets. Recent battles in Mohnyin–Myitkyina and Hpa-An show drone advantages flipping to EAOs/PDFs.
- Impact 
 Over $1B in arms imports since 2021, yet vulnerabilities persist.
 4. Truth on Cyber and Electronic Warfare 
- Junta Claim: Electronic superiority determines victory; cyber ops integrated.
- Reality Check: No long-range EW systems confirmed. Resistance comms remain active; airstrikes miss targets due to poor intel.
- Evidence: Incidents like December 5 Sagaing strike (20+ civilian deaths) highlight accuracy failures. Cross-border shelling into Thailand underscores indiscriminate tactics.
- Impact: Hype masks declining effectiveness.
 5. Truth on Precision Weapons and Air Power 
- Junta Claim: Modern precision munitions ensure accurate outcomes.
- Reality Check: Mostly unguided strikes; high civilian casualties (1,200+ in 2025). Air fleet constrained by attrition and shortages.
- Evidence: Russian helicopters (Mi-38) and jets imported, but sorties reduced. Patterns from 2023–2025 show targeting errors.
- Impact: "Superiority" is theoretical; ground gains by resistance prove otherwise.
 6. Summary Table of Truths vs Claims
| Junta Claim | Verifiable Truth |
|-------------|------------------|
| AI real-time tracking | No deployed systems; manual intel dominates |
| Counter-drone improvements | Limited tech; resistance drones dominate skies |
| Electronic/cyber dominance | Minimal EW; comms intact for EAOs/PDFs |
| Precision air superiority | Unguided strikes; high errors and casualties |
| Tech shifts battlefield | Aspirational; junta faces vulnerabilities |
 7. Final Truth Assessment
These truths reveal MAH's statements as strategic messaging to project strength ahead of sham elections (starting December 28, 2025). Battlefield outcomes show widening gaps: increasing resistance advances, foreign dependency, and civilian tolls. SSISM commits to disseminating these facts for accountability.
